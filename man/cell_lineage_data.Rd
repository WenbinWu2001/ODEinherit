\title{Cell Lineage Time Series Dataset}
\format{
A named list with two elements:
\describe{
\item{\code{metadata}}{A data frame providing cell lineage and timing information. Columns include:
\itemize{
\item \code{cell_id}: Unique identifier for each cell.
\item \code{mother_id}: Identifier of the mother cell; \code{"root"} indicates a founder cell (seeded at the start of the experiment).
\item \code{cell_birth_timepoint}: Time index at which the cell is born. This corresponds to the column index in the time series matrices (excluding the first column).
}
}
\item{\code{time_series}}{A named list of six protein time series matrices:
\itemize{
\item \code{Cdc10}, \code{Stb3}, \code{CLB5}, \code{Whi5}, \code{Xbp1}, \code{Tup1}
}
Each matrix has rows representing cells and columns representing uniformly spaced time points.
The first column is \code{cell_id}, matching those in \code{metadata}. Values before each cell's birth are \code{NA}.
}
}
}
\usage{
cell_lineage_data
}
\description{
A dataset containing cell lineage metadata and time series of protein expression for a set of mother–daughter cell pairs.
}
\details{
Time series data were denoised using functional principal component analysis and interpolated to 5× temporal resolution using local polynomial smoothing.
The dataset includes 25 mother cells and 60 daughter cells, each measured on a common grid of 240 time points (uniformly spaced) across the experiment (originally 48 time points before interpolation).
