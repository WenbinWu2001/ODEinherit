\title{Convert theta coefficients to a regulatory network.}
\usage{
theta_to_adj_matrix(interaction_term, res_theta)
}
\arguments{
\item{interaction_term}{A logical value indicating whether the model includes interaction effects.}

\item{res_theta}{A numeric matrix whose columns contain the estimated $\theta_j$ values for each variable.
\itemize{
\item If \code{interaction_term = FALSE}, \code{res_theta} must have dimensions (\code{p}, \code{p}).
\item If \code{interaction_term = TRUE}, \code{res_theta} must have dimensions (\code{p^2}, \code{p}).
}}
}
\value{
A numeric adjacency matrix of dimension (\code{p}, \code{p}) representing the
regulatory network, where 1 indicates a regulatory effect and 0 indicates none.
If \code{interaction_term = TRUE}, a fully connected network is returned with a warning.
}
\description{
Converts the estimated theta coefficients ($\theta_j$'s) into an adjacency
matrix representing the regulatory network between variables.
Currently, only the non-interaction model (\code{interaction = FALSE}) is supported.
